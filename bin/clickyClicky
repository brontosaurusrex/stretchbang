      #A move and resize argument has the format 'g,x,y,w,h'.  All five components are integers.  The  first
      #value, g, is the gravity of the window, with 0 being the most common value (the default value for the
      #window). Please see the EWMH specification for other values.

      #The four remaining values are a standard geometry specification: x,y is the position of the top  left
      #corner  of  the  window,  and  w,h is the width and height of the window, with the exception that the
      #value of -1 in any position is interpreted to mean that the current geometry value should not be mod‚Äê
      #ified.
